Nixpkgs that i use in my [nix-config](https://github.com/bearoffwork/nix-config), inspired by [reckenrode/nix-packages](https://github.com/reckenrode/nix-packages).

Uses a simplified [RFC-140](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0140-simple-package-paths.md) structure - basically just `pkgs/by-name/{package}/package.nix` without the shard directories.
